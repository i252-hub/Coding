hello = f"You {verb_one} my {noun_one} but not my {noun_two}. {noun_three} {verb_two},\
you didn't know what to {verb_three}. A {noun_four} {noun_five} speak in silence \
    and it {verb_four} the {noun_six} that was once given.  Silence {verb_five} a thousand\
    words and yet it was never once {verb_six}. I {verb_seven} you into the\

                                of you and left some tears\

                                        like the sky who cannot swim\
                                            in the depth of my soul, and likewise\
